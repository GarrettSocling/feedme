Documentation of this ridiculously complex procedure:

On the web server, create /var/www/feedme and /var/www/feeds.
Then must both be writable by the web server's user (probably www-data).

Create /var/www/feedme/.config with an appropriate config file.

Copy urlrss to /var/www/feedme/urlrss.cgi and make sure it's executable.

Install SL4A and Python for Android on your Android device:
- Download both sl4a_r6.apk and PythonForAndroid_r4.apk
- Install sl4a from the apk
- Find SL4A in Applications and run it. It will say "no matches found",
  but that's okay: the important thing is that it creates the directory
  /sdcard/sl4a/scripts, without which PythonForAndroid will fail to install.
- Install PythonForAndroid from the apk
- Find Python for Android in Applications and run it. Tap Install.
- Go back to the home screen and run SL4A again, and now you should
  see scripts.

Edit feedfetcher.py to point to your server.
Then copy feedfetcher.py into sl4a/scripts/ on your Android device.

Optional: Make a home screen shortcut for feedfetcher:
- Hit the add icon button ("+") on the main screen.
- Shortcut-->Scripts-->Select script-->Select foreground or background
