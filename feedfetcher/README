How to set up feedme so that it runs remotely on a web server,
triggered from a laptop or android device:

On the web server, create $SERVERDIR/feedme and $SERVERDIR/feeds
($SERVERDIR will probably be /var/www/ for simple setups).
They must both be writable by the web server's user (probably www-data).
Once feedmeparser.py has been created, $SERVERDIR/feedme probably
no longer needs to be writable, but $SERVERDIR/feeds and
/$SERVERDIR/feedme/.cache/feedme still will need to remain
writable by www-data forever.

When you copy over your .config/feedme/feedme.conf, make sure
that dir = points to a directory writable by the web server.
If you were using something like ~/feeds for your own homedir,
that may cause feedme not to start (and there will be no obvious
error message in that case, since it will have no place to
log the error).

Create $SERVERDIR/feedme/.config with an appropriate config file.

Copy urlrss to $SERVERDIR/feedme/urlrss.cgi and make sure it's executable.

Install SL4A and Python for Android on your Android device:
- Download both sl4a_r6.apk and PythonForAndroid_r4.apk
- Install sl4a from the apk
- Find SL4A in Applications and run it. It will say "no matches found",
  but that's okay: the important thing is that it creates the directory
  /sdcard/sl4a/scripts, without which PythonForAndroid will fail to install.
- Install PythonForAndroid from the apk
- Find Python for Android in Applications and run it. Tap Install.
- Go back to the home screen and run SL4A again, and now you should
  see scripts.

Edit feedfetcher.py to point to your server.
Then copy feedfetcher.py into sl4a/scripts/ on your Android device.
(Or use it on a laptop or desktop.)

Optional: Make a home screen shortcut for feedfetcher:
- Hit the add icon button ("+") on the main screen.
- Shortcut-->Scripts-->Select script-->Select foreground or background
