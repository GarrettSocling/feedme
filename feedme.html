<h1>FeedMe: a Lightweight Feed/RSS reader</h1>

<p>
Ever want to download RSS from news sites or blogs to your phone,
PDA, ebook reader, or other handheld device to read offline?

<p>
Feedme is a program for fetching stories from RSS or Atom feeds, from
news sites, blogs or any other site that offers a feed.
It saves simplified HTML files, or can translate to other formats
such as Epub, FB2, Plucker or plain text for devices that can't handle HTML.

<p>
<b>Download:</b> <a href="feedme-0.9.tar.gz">feedme-0.9.tar.gz</a>.</b>

<p>
You will need Python, and python's feedparser module (on Ubuntu or Arch,
that's the package <i>python-feedparser</i>) and lxml (package python-lxml).

<p>
I know there are lots of other RSS readers -- but they all seem
oriented toward converting RSS to mail to be read in an HTML-capable
mail reader. I get enough mail, which I read in Mutt without much HTML
support. I wanted a way to get it onto a handheld device in an easily
readable, simple format that displays well on a small screen, without
images and tables and stylesheets and javascript and all that other
HTML cruft, and in a self-contained way so I can read it without
needing a net connection or using up data allocation.

<p>
So I wrote FeedMe. I've been using it daily for many years, so I guess
it works well enough for my purposes. Maybe it will work for you too.

<p>
FeedMe is sort of an RSS version of
<a href="http://sitescooper.taint.org/">Sitescooper</a>.
It produces either HTML or <a href="http://plkr.org">Plucker</a> format.

<h2>The feedme.conf file</h2>

<p>
The <a href="feedme.conf">sample feedme.conf configuration file</a>
should be vaguely self-explanatory. Install it in
<i>~/$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/feedme/feedme.conf</i> or
<i>~/.config/feedme/feedme.conf</i>.
Here are options inside it:

<h3>Site options</h3>
<p>
The feedme.conf file starts with a set of default options,
in a section labeled <code>[DEFAULT]</code>.

<p>
These options apply to the whole feedme process:

<pre>
  ascii
    Convert all pages to plain ASCII. Useful for reading devices like Palm
    that can't display other character sets reliably.
  dir
    Where to save the collected pages.
    See save_days for how long they will be kept.
  formats
    Comma-separated list of output formats.
    Default "none", which will result in HTML output.
    Other options: epub, fb2, plucker.
  verbose
    Print lots of debugging chatter while feeding.
  min_width
    The minimum number of characters in an item link. Links shorter than this
    will be padded to this length (to make tapping easier). Default 25.
  save_days
    How long to retain feeds locally.
</pre>

<p>
These options can be set in the <code>[DEFAULT]</code> section
and may be overridden for specific feeds:

<pre>
  continue_on_timeout
    Normally, if one page times out, feedme will assume the site is down.
    On sites that link to content from many different URLs, set this
    to true.
  encoding
    Normally feedme will try to guess the encoding from the page.
    But some pages lie, so use this to override that.
  levels
    Level 1: only save the RSS page.
    Level 2: save sub-pages.
  nocache
    Don't check whether we've seen an entry before: collect everything.
  nonlocal_images
    Normally feedme will ignore images from other domains (usually ads).
    But some sites link to images from all over; set this to true in that case.
  skip_images
    Don't save images. Default true.
  skip_links:
    For sites with levels=1 where you just want a single news feed and
    never want to click on anything (e.g. slashdot), this can eliminate
    distracting links that you might tap on accidentally while scrolling.
  url
    The RSS URL for the site.
</pre>

<h3>Defining a new feed</h3>
<p>
To define each new feed, start by defining the URL.
Then go to the RSS page in a browser, click on a story,
view the HTML source of the story, find the place where the actual story
begins (it may be three quarters of the way down the page or even
farther) and find something that indicates the start of the story,
after all the sidebars and advertising and tracking javascript and
other cruft. Save this as <code>page_start</code>.
Optionally, scroll down to the end of the story and find
a <code>page_end</code> as well.
<pre>
url = http://example.com/feeds.rss
page_start = <story>
page_end = </story>
</pre>

<p>
There are quite a few other options you can set for the feed.
Of course, you can override values like levels, nocache, skip_images
and so forth. Here are some additional options you may want for
some sites:
<pre>
single_page_pat
  Sites that spread stories over many pages often have a naming
  convention in their "view as single page" URLs. This is a pattern,
  e.g. http://exmaple.com/.*single.html
skip_pat
  For sites that embed annoying things in the middle of stories:
  maybe video clips, or ads, or distracting pull-quotes.
  Anything matching a skip_pat will be deleted from the story.
when
  When to check this site, if not every time.
  May be a weekday, e.g. Sat, or a month date, e.g. 1 to check only
  on the first day of any month.
</pre>

<p>
A few options, like page_start, page_end, single_page_pat, and skip_pat,
can specify multiple patterns. Specify them by putting them on separate
lines (whitespace at the beginning is optional and ignored):
<pre>
skip_pat = style=".*?"
  Follow us on.*?</div>
</pre>

<h3>Output Formats</h3>
<p>
Supported formats since 0.7 include plucker and epub; to get them,
set <code>formats = epub</code> (or plucker, or plucker,epub to get both).
For HTML only and no additional formats, set <code>formats = none</code>
<p>
Downloaded HTML will be put in ~/feeds/ (which must exist; you can
specify a different location in feedme.conf).
<p>
Feedme can then convert the HTML into one of three formats:
epub, plucker, or fb2. You'll need to have appropriate conversion tools
installed on your system: plucker for plucker format, calibre's
ebook-convert for the other two. You can specify more than one format,
separated by commas, in feedme.conf; or format=none if you only need
the downloaded HTML.
<p>
FeedMe can optionally convert each page to plain ascii, eliminating
accented characters and such (displaying them used to be a problem
on Palm PDAs, but shouldn't be needed for most modern devices).
For this option, set <code>ascii="yes"</code> in feedme.conf
and install my <a href="../ununicode/">ununicode</a> module
somewhere in your python path.

<h2>Maintenance:</h2>
Feedme uses three important directories:
<p>
Feedme's configuration file is <i>~/.config/feedme/feedme.conf</i>.
<p>
Feedme's cache is <i>~/.cache/feedme/feedme.dat</i>.
This file should remain relatively small if you have a sane number of feeds,
but it doesn't hurt to keep an eye on it.
<p>
~/feeds is where it stores the downloaded HTML. 
Stories are downloaded as <i>sitename/number.html</i>, e.g.
<i>~/feeds/BBC_World_News/2.html</i>. These stories are cleaned
out every <i>save_days</i> (set in your feedme.conf).
<p>
If you save to formats beyond plain HTML, there may be other directories
used for the converted files; for example, plucker files are created in
<i>~/.plucker/feeds</i>.
This is never cleaned out by feedme, so you'll have to prune it yourself.
When I used plucker as my feed
reader, I had an alias that ran <code>rm ~/.plucker/feedme/*</code> 
to remove the  previous day's plucks just before I ran feedme.

<p>
FeedMe's license is GPLv2 or (at your option) later.
Thanks to Carla Schroder for the name suggestion!

<p>
FeedMe is now maintained on <a href="https://github.com/akkana/feedme">GitHub:
FeedMe</a>.

<h2>Reading it</h2>
<p>
Currently, I read the feeds I fetch with Feedme with an Android program
I wrote,
<a href="/software/FeedViewer/">FeedViewer</a>.
I'm the first to confess that it's not very well documented, though,
and in particular there's no documentation on how to set things up
so that FeedMe can generate files that FeedFetcher can generate
automatically. If you're trying to use this and can't figure it out,
let me know, otherwise I may never get around to documenting it.
